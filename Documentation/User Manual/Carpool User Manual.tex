\section{Introduction}
Carpooling is a method of sharing unoccupied seats in a car with people who commute along the
same route. Usually, one person from the group drives their personal car and the others all share the cost of the trip. Due to the environmental crisis that the world faces, carpooling has become immensely popular as it reduces the number of cars on the road. Of recent carpooling has become the latest trend as petrol prices continue to increase. Carpooling has evolved into a viable, cost-effective,
and stress-free mode of transportation. Finding individuals to carpool with is challenging, since it is difficult to locate someone travelling to the same destination at the same time as you. This Carpool application is a solution to this problem.\\ \\
Carpool is a mobile application that helps students find affordable transport to and from campus or longer trips such as returning home for semester break. Carpool provides students with a central location whereby they can post, find, and join safe car trips. This application allows students with vehicles to save on petrol costs as well as provide affordable transportation to students who do not have vehicles. Students can travel to their desired location while sharing the car and expenditures.\\ \\
This document serves as an instruction manual for a user to run the Carpool Application. The document specifies what the user needs in order to run the application as well as how the user can navigate through the application.
